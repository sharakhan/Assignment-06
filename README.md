#### 7) Create a README file to answer the following question-


#### 1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?
        Ans: Var: var Can be reassigned.
                  Can be re-declared in the same scope.
                  Function-scoped
                  
            Let : let Can be reassigned.
                  Can be re-declared in the same scope.
                  Block-scoped

            Const : const Cannot be reassigned.But if it’s an object/array,can still change what’s inside it.
                    Cannot be re-declared in the same scope.
                    Block-scoped

#### 2) What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()?
        Ans: map() : Use map() to change items and get a new list.
                    It returns a new array.
                    Does not modify the original array.

        forEach() : Use forEach() when  only need side effects.Just go through every item and do something.
                    It returns Undefined.
                    It does not give back a new array.
                    Can modify the original array.

        filter() : Use filter() when we want to select some elements.
                   It returns a new array.
                   Keep only elements that match condition.

#### 3) What are arrow functions in ES6?
        Ans : Arrow functions in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) are a concise syntax for writing function expressions in JavaScript.
              Arrow functions are a shorter way to write functions in JavaScript.If the function body contains only a single expression, you can omit the braces and the return keyword.But if there is only one parameter, parentheses can be omitted.If there are no parameters, use empty parentheses.
              Traditional function hoisted.But arrow function not hoisted.

#### 4) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?

#### 5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?
